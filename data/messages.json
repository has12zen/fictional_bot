  "addRoleFail": "Hey there! I was trying to assign you your branch and year role but failed, probably because I know too less about you.\nYou can get your role by sending an easy command in the bot-commands channel. The command is !assign YYBB where YYBB is the initial four characters of your roll number. For example, if you're 20CS01001 you can send !assign 20CS . Please remember that 20cs/20Cs/20cS will all be invalid. I'm a little busy right now will open the bot-commands channel after 10-15 minutes, please try ONLY when it is open, do not reply here.",
  "verifFail": "Verification failed!!!!, \nYou forgot to fill the google form, Didn't you?\nIf you filled it try using the !refresh command and trying to verify again.\n`if problem persists wait for 1 day before trying to verify again.`\nCheck the pinned messages in #verif for more help\nsend a message in #verif that you are unable to verify even after waiting 24 hrs and the admins will help you with you situation",
